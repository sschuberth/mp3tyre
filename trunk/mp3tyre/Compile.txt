While for the original version (up to the "mp3TYRE-9.2006.feb.19" distribution)
Delphi 6 Professional was used for development, the sources were also successfully
compiled using Delphi 2005 Personal (which is freely distributed with computer
magazines, but not available for download). The more recent Turbo Delphi Explorer
(http://www.turboexplorer.com/delphi/) has not been tried yet.

Current development is done with Free Pascal / Lazarus as it is Open Source and
has a 64-bit compiler freely available. You may get a recent snapshot version of
Lazarus incl. Free Pascal from here:
