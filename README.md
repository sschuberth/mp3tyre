# About

mp3TYRE (for MP3 TYpe REnamer) is a tool to add an infix to MP3 file names that indicates the type of the file (CBR, VBR, and / or mp3PRO etc.). It can also report and clean MP3 files from junk data, broken frames and fix tags while keeping the any meta-information intact.

# Compiling

While for the original version (up to the "mp3TYRE-9.2006.feb.19" distribution) Delphi 6 Professional was used for development, the sources were also successfully compiled using Delphi 2005 Personal (which is freely distributed with computer magazines, but not available for download). The more recent Turbo Delphi Explorer (http://www.turboexplorer.com/delphi/) has not been tried yet.

Current development is done with Free Pascal / Lazarus as it is Open Source and has a 64-bit compiler freely available. You may get a recent snapshot version of Lazarus incl. Free Pascal from here:
